# Data_Parsing
This project parses a data file to search for humans, their age, and if they own a car or not. 
It can also find Wolves and the kennels they may belong to. There are also functions to find which Kennel holds the largest combined weight of wolves they have. 
And finally it can calculate the total weight of all the wolves in the text file. 

This was a short project completed in Java.
